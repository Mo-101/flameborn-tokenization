# The Flameborn Manifesto

We were born not to beg for change, but to create it.

Flameborn is a sovereign initiative powered by Africa, designed to end health injustice through technology, radical transparency, and human-first funding models.

Our tokens are not collectibles. They are proof that someone stood for life.

We build to:

- Fund verified health workers
- Respond to emergencies without waiting
- Make giving traceable, meaningful, and automatic

We do not chase fame.
We chase **function, healing, and hope.**

ðŸ”¥ This is the way of Flameborn.
