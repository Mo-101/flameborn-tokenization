# No Malice Charter

Flameborn must never be wielded by a dark hand.

- It shall not be used to harm, surveil, exploit, or manipulate others.
- It may never be used in warfare, oppression, or political coercion.
- Flameborn is **for peace, for truth, and for life only.**

Any project or person proven to violate these principles forfeits association and support from the Flameborn system.

Let no fire rise to consume the innocent.
Let every fire we raise illuminate the path forward.

üõ°Ô∏è This charter cannot be revoked.
